    1. Import the data from API using requests library.
    
    2. The imported data was in json format hence we used json library to read the data.
    
    3. We looked for null values and replaced it with zero, looked for duplicates.
    
    4. Stated analysing the data by using pandas function like groupby, sort_values etc.
    
    5. Used nested 'for' loops to extract the relevant data from the nested dictionary.
    
    6. Extracted the individual state data from dataframe in csv format and imported data into MySQL.
    
    7. Aggregated the distribution by month and week wise for each state.
    
    8. Imported the aggregated data into Excel for further Analysis.
